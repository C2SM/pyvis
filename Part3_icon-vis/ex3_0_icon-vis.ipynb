    "# Exercise 3.0: icon-vis\n",
    "prepared by A. Lauber\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will work with the GitHub repository [icon-vis](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis), which was developed by C2SM and MeteoSwiss. It is a collection of Python scripts for plotting data on unstructured grids like the ICON grid. It is based on the library [psyplot](https://psyplot.github.io), which was already introduced in [Exercise 2.2](../Part2_Mapplots/ex2_2_psyplot.ipynb). The repo has an associated self-developed Python package [iconarray](https://github.com/C2SM/iconarray), which contains various modules to facilitate working with ICON data with xarray or other xarray based tools. We already used it in Exercise 2.2 for the formatoptions.\n",

    "### Clone icon-vis repo\n",
    "For this course the repository is already available two folders up. Generally, you would need to `git clone https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "If you want to use icon-vis on your own machine, please follow the [installation instruction](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis#environment-setup) in the README. For this course, the needed packages are already installed as part of the pyvis environment to save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data file formats\n",
    "The scripts work with NetCDF and GRIB files. The iconarray package provides functions to make the datasets ready for plotting ([Plotting GRIB/NETCDF ICON Data](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis#plotting-gribnetcdf-icon-data))."
