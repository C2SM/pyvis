    "- Under the `Properties` tab in the bottom left:\n",
    "  - Leave the `Dimensions` to be `(lev,lat,lon)`\n",
    "  - **Uncheck** the option `Replace Fill Value With Nan`\n",
    "  - Choose the `Output Type` to be `Structured Grid`\n",
    " - Click on `Apply`\n",
    " - You will notice that one of the dimensions is much longer than the others. Vertical levels are probably in Pascals\n",
    " - Let's use our first filter: `Calculator`\n",
    " - Click on the loaded data in the `Pipeline Browser` (top left) and click on `Filters -> Alphabetical -> Calculator`\n",
    " - In the `Properties` section of the calculator:\n",
    "   - **Check** `Coordinate Output`\n",
    "   - Type the formula: coordsX\\*iHat+coordsY\\*jHat+coordsZ\\*0.001\\*kHat\n",
    " - Click on `Apply`\n",
    " - Think about what we have just done and look at other options in the `Calculator` properties\n",
    " - (extra:) can you rescale the coordinates using the `Transform` filter\n",
    " - Center the data in UI\n",
    " - Change the representation from `Outline` to `Surface` representation in the toolbar\n",
    " - Change `Solid Color` to a data field\n",
    " - Try to interact with the data\n",
    " - Get familiar with the interface: e.g. play animations\n",
    " - Change the color bar which can be accessed by scrolling down in the Calculator `properties` and clicking on `Edit` under  `Coloring`\n",
    " - Select the `Calculator` in the `Pipeline Browser` and apply the `Slice` filter to it (`Filters -> Alphabetical -> Slice`)\n",
    " - Change the orientation of the `Slice` plane by changing the `Normal` to `(0,0,1)` under `Plane Parameters` and click on `Apply`\n",
    " - Play around with the Slice parameters and try to create multiple slices\n",
    " - Delete the `Slice` filter (right click on `Slice` in the `Pipeline Browser` and delete)\n",
    " - Apply the `Clip` filter and clip part of the domain\n",
    " - Apply the `Clip` filter again, change the plane orientation and clip the domain along another dimension"
