# What's New

## Versions

### 1.1.0 (unreleased)

 * `np.random.randint` is exclusive (closes [GH1][i1])
 * use `np.asarray` instead of `np.array`, because it does not copy the data (closes [GH2][i2])
 * explain arguments of `plt.subplots` (closes [GH6][i6] and [GH7][i7])
 * explain why np.newaxis is needed in ex1_2 (broadcasting) (closes [GH10][i10])
 * ex3_2 fix typos and colormap range (closes [GH17][i17] and [GH19][i19])
 * use `plt.scatter?` for help, as `ax.scatter?` returns the cartopy scatter function (closes [GH18][i18])


### 1.0.0 (06.02.2018)

 * Version used for the first pyvis course.
 * Create release.
